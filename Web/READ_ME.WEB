			--- FWEB SOURCE CODE ---

This subdirectory Fweb/Web contains the source code for the FWEB
processors, both the original web sources and the tangled results *.c and
*.h.  Please refer to INSTALL_FWEB.tex for descriptions of the files,
although that should not be necessary for usual installations.

To compile these files, use the Makefile if possible.

To install FWEB, Unix users should run ./configure.  Please refer to
../READ_ME.FWEB for further instructions.
