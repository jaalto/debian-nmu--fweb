		    --- BOOTSTRAPPING FWEB with MVS ---
			       Version 1.30
			       May 15, 1993

   This directory is intended to handle non-ASCII machines, specifically
IBM EBCDIC machines.  The bootstrap has been tested so far only with the
MVS operating system.  You may have to make some changes in custom.h for
your system.  If you do so, please let me know.

   Version 1.30 hasn't yet been test for MVS.  Sorry.
