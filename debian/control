Description: literate-programming tool for C/C++/Fortran/Ratfor
 Literate-programming allows the programmer to write a program's
 code and its code's documentation, with equal importance accorded
 to both. This helps producing a well-documented code.
 .
 FWEB has grown out of Knuth and Levy's CWEB; it is far more
 configurable and customizable than the original, uses LaTeX to
 typeset documented code, provides a very powerful macro processor...
 .
 Ratfor programmers may appreciate the builtin Ratfor-to-Fortran
 translator if they don't have the right compiler.
 .
 Other languages than those cited may be used, but without code
 pretty-printing.
