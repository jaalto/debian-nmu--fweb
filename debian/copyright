This is Debian GNU/Linux's prepackaged version of the John A. Krommes'
FWEB program. 

This package was put together by me, Yann Dirson <dirson@debian.org>,
from the John A. Krommes' sources, which I obtained from
ftp://ftp.pppl.gov/pub/fweb/fweb-1.60-beta.tar.gz.

Please note that for now (1998/03/13), the source of this beta release
has been removed from this server and its mirrors, in anticipation of
the final 1.60 release.

The changes were very minimal - merely adding support for the Debian
package maintenance scheme, by adding various debian/* files.
